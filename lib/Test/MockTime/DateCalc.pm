=head1 NAME

Test::MockTime::DateCalc -- fake time for Date::Calc functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Test::MockTime;
 use Test::MockTime::DateCalc; # before Date::Calc loads
 # ...
 use My::Module::Using::Date::Calc;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Test::MockTime::DateCalc> arranges for the functions in C<Date::Calc> to
follow the Perl level C<time> function (see L<perlfunc>), and in particular
any fake date/time set there by C<Test::MockTime>.  The following
C<Date::Calc> functions are changed

    System_Clock
    Today
    Now
    Today_and_Now
    This_Year

    Gmtime
    Localtime
    Timezone
    Time_to_Date

C<Gmtime>, C<Localtime>, C<Timezone> and C<Time_to_Date> are made to default
to the Perl-level current C<time>.  When called with an explicit time
argument they're unchanged.

=head2 Module Load Order

C<Test::MockTime> or similar fakery must be loaded first, before anything
with a C<time()> call, which includes C<Test::MockTime::DateCalc>.  This is
the same as all C<CORE::GLOBAL> overrides, see L<CORE/OVERRIDING CORE
FUNCTIONS>.

C<Test::MockTime::DateCalc> must be loaded before C<Date::Calc>.  If
C<Date::Calc> is already loaded then its functions might have been imported
into other modules and such imports are not affected by the redefinitions
made.  For that reason C<Test::MockTime::DateCalc> demands it be the one to
load C<Date::Calc> for the first time.  Usually this simply means having
C<Test::MockTime::DateCalc> at the start of a test script, before the things
you're going to test.

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Test::MockTime ':all';
    use Test::MockTime::DateCalc;

    use My::Foo::Bar;

    set_fixed_time('1981-01-01T00:00:00Z');
    is (My::Foo::Bar::something(), 1981);
    restore_time();

In a test script it's often good to have your own modules early to check
they correctly load their pre-requisites.  You might want a separate test
script for that so you don't accidentally rely on
C<Test::MockTime::DateCalc> loading C<Date::Calc> for you.

=head2 Other Faking Modules

C<Test::MockTime::DateCalc> can be used with other modules which mangle the
Perl-level C<time> too.  For example C<Time::Fake>,

    use Time::Fake;                # fakery first
    use Test::MockTime::DateCalc;

Or C<Time::Mock>,

    use Time::Mock;                # fakery first
    use Test::MockTime::DateCalc;

C<Time::Warp> (as of version 0.5) only exports a new C<time>, it's not a
core override and so can't be used with C<Test::MockTime::DateCalc>.
